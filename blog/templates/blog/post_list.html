<h2><a href="">My first post</a></h2>
<p>Have you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology and you are somehow left behind? Have you ever
wondered how to create a website but have never had enough motivation to start? Have you ever thought that the software
world is too complicated for you to even try doing something on your own?
Well, we have good news for you! Programming is not as hard as it seems and we want to show you how fun it can be.
This tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. If you want to be good at it, you need months or even years of
learning and practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating websites is not as complicated as it seems.
We will try to explain different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will not feel intimidated by technology.
We hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we do!.</p>

<p>It is amazing to take part in a Django Girls workshop, but we are aware that it is not always possible to attend one. This is
why we encourage you to try following this tutorial at home. For readers at home we are currently preparing videos that will
make it easier to follow the tutorial on your own. It is still a work in progress, but more and more things will be covered soon
at the Coding is for girls YouTube channel.
In every chapter already covered, there is a link that points to the correct video..</p>
